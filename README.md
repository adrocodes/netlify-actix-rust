# Netlify Actix Rust

A **WIP** experiment to see if I can get a simple web server to run on Netlify using the Actix Web Rust framework.

- [Actix](https://actix.rs/)
- [Netlify Docs](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#rust)

This probably won't work as a pure deployment - I think instead, I need to deploy a Netlify Function that runs Rust instead.
